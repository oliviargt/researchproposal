              <h1>Virtual Study Abroad: The New Future of Study Abroad?</h>
              <h2>By: Olivia Geist</h2>
              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p> Virtual study abroad options have become increasingly popular in universities during the Covid-19 pandemic, especially because it gives students the opportunity to achieve some level of study abroad in a time when international travel is extremely limited and difficult. Virtual study abroad options are also generally cheaper and more accessible to students who’s area of study makes studying abroad difficult. Virtual study abroad is worth researching because it holds a lot of potential to make studying abroad during college more accessible. For example, at PSU, the cost of studying abroad is one of the main reasons students are unable to study abroad, and virtual study abroad could offer a new alternative. However, do students who study abroad virtually gain the same skills and experiences as students who actually go abroad? Is studying abroad virtually able to provide students with the necessary skills to enter an increasingly globalized world?</p>
              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>Many studies on virtual study abroad programs have allowed researchers to discover numerous beneficial aspects of studying abroad virtually. In their study, Immaculada Pertusa-Seva and Melissa A. Stewart researched how technology and virtual study abroad could enhance Spanish curriculum. In the study they followed two groups of students, one in Segovia, Spain and another at the Kentucky Institute for International Studies participating in a virtual study abroad program where they interacted with the students living abroad. Through a survey conducted at the end of the trial, the researchers found that the experience had positive results for those who studied abroad virtually, specifically in encouraging them to study abroad in the future. The study encouraged universities to adapt a more accessible study abroad program into their curriculum, especially when it came to language learning. Similarly, another article titled “Virtual Study-Abroad Through Web Conferencing: Sharing Knowledge and Building Cultural Appreciation in Nursing Education and Practice” studied how a virtual study abroad experience helped nursing students become global citizens. Through a web conference and engaging activities, researchers found that the themes amongst all students whether they went abroad or participated from home gained skills in global collaboration, cultural appreciation, and new perspectives. Ultimately, the researchers concluded that while a virtual experience is not the same as physically studying abroad, it does offer a way to “engage in global learning experiences without travel” (797). In an article by Courtney Dorroll and Begona Caballero-Garcia, they studied how virtual exchanges in times of limited international travel can offer an alternative to traditional study abroad. They conducted a literature review as well as two case studies. They framed this within a Brazilian educator Paulo Freire’s theoretical ideas about social justice in the classroom, as well as the ethical practices in studying abroad. Ultimately, they came to a similar conclusion: that studying abroad virtually offers a way to, as they put it, “start to bridge the cultural and physical divide” (160). While it is clear that studying abroad virtually can provide a beneficial alternative to studying abroad, particularly in times when traditional study abroad is not available, I felt that further research could be geared towards specific reasons why students do not study abroad and how virtual study abroad could offer an alternative way for students to gain the skills and experiences of studying abroad. In particular, how could studying abroad virtually work to close the ‘gender gap’ in studying abroad? In 2016-2017, nationally only 32.7 percent of study abroad students were men (University of Texas).</p>
