              <h1>Virtual Study Abroad: The New Future of Study Abroad?</h>
              <h2>By: Olivia Geist</h2>
              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p> Virtual study abroad options have become increasingly popular in universities during the Covid-19 pandemic, especially because it gives students the opportunity to achieve some level of study abroad in a time when international travel is extremely limited and difficult. Virtual study abroad options are also generally cheaper and more accessible to students whoâ€™s area of study makes studying abroad difficult. Virtual study abroad is worth researching because it holds a lot of potential to make studying abroad during college more accessible. For example, at PSU, the cost of studying abroad is one of the main reasons students are unable to study abroad, and virtual study abroad could offer a new alternative. However, do students who study abroad virtually gain the same skills and experiences as students who actually go abroad? Is studying abroad virtually able to provide students with the necessary skills to enter an increasingly globalized world?</p>
